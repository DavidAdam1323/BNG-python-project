# Band Name Generator

The Band Name Generator is a Python script designed to create unique band names based on user inputs. It prompts the user to enter their favorite color, animal, music style, and number, then combines these inputs to form a creative band name.

**Usage:**

To use the Band Name Generator, follow these steps:

1. Run the Python script.
2. You will be prompted to enter:
   - Your favorite color

3. After entering these inputs, the script will generate a band name and display it to you.

Suppose you enter:

- Color: Blue
- Animal: Tiger
- Music Style: Rock
- Number: 7

The generated band name would be:
